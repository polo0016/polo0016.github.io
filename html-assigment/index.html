                My name is Angela Maria Polo Villamizar, and I was born on July 12<sup>th</sup>, 1996, in Bogot√°, Colombia. Three years ago, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in social communications and Journalism at <em>Sergio Arboleda University</em>. After that, I decided to move to the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr> for two years to be an Au Pair. Now, I'm in Canada studying Interactive Media Design at <em>Algonquin College</em>.

                My biggest hobby is Youtube! I uploaded my first video on  April 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2016. I've uploaded 259 videos on my main channel in these five years! This journey has taught me to work hard for my dreams and be persistent. That reminds me of one of my favourite quotes:
